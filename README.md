<h1>Cafe Sales Data Cleaning Project</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project involved cleaning and preparing a café sales dataset (downloaded from Kaggle: https://lnkd.in/gi6b-vm2) to ensure data quality and usability for analysis. The dataset contained 8 columns with missing values, invalid entries, and inconsistencies. Using SQL and SQL Server as the primary work environment, I performed comprehensive data cleaning, error correction, and feature engineering to create a reliable dataset for future analytics.
